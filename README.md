library-boilerplate
=========================

An opinionated setup I plan to use for my libraries.
The idea is to have a ***React-cssmodules-es6-compatible-and-testable-also-with-a-build-process-integrated-template*** :)

### TODO
- [x] HMR / Hot-reload
- [x] Css Modules
- [x] Validate that it has CommonJS builds.
- [x] Babel
- [x] Webpack
- [x] ESLint
- [ ] Add tests examples for Ava + Enzyme.
- [x] Add logic for css handling (Or extraction??)
- [x] Fix build process(?)

See `package.json` in the root and the example folder for the list of the available commands.

Note that this is an *opinionated* boilerplate.
(You have been warned)

Kudos to [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) for the [initial project idea](https://github.com/gaearon/library-boilerplate) where this was forked and modified from -  https://github.com/gaearon/library-boilerplate
